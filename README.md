htop-like demo application based on [gui.cs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs)

##What it is?
I just wanted to create something beautiful like htop to experiment with gui.cs. It is still far from htop, but it shows the possibilities.

- It uses a new HtopProgressBar that is simply a copy of the original but with a new caret to mimic htop.
- ReadOnlyTextView a full copy of the original TextView that is not ready to edit but to navigate line by line with cursor arrows.
